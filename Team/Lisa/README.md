When looking at the data, I began to wonder what the difference in downloads were based upon their OS version.  
Upon reviewing the data, Version 4.1 or higher was clearly the operating system with the most downloads.  To 
learn why, I researched technology innovations in 2012, the release year of Version 4.1 and discovered that
Windows Phone 8, HTC One X+, and Samsung's Galaxy S III were all released that year.  Understanding that most
apps downloaded were productivity and tools, it is possible these apps were pre-loaded on the new Android phones.


Prior to investigating the question above, I wanted to look at the possible correlation between sentiment, 
sentiment_polarity and ratings.  However the initial results were predictable, a more positive sentiment_polarity 
correlated with higher rating.  What was surprising was that sentiment was evenly distributed regardless of rating.
For example, a rating of 2.5 was as likely to have a positive rating as a negative rating.
